# Playground project for rendering cheatsheets

## Content 

A PDF cheat sheets PDF for NATS, NATS CLI and Synadia

## TODO

Once content is done abandon code and move the content to typst. 
* https://typst.app/
* https://github.com/typst/typst

## The code

Limited re-usability. Mostly for fun. Will probably transform this to typst when the content is done.

Design goals:
* Render structured cheatsheets as PDF using PDFBox
* Auto layout
* Allow for content and style adjustment while retaining consistent look and feel
