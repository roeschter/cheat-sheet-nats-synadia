# NATS CLI and NATS product cheat sheets

## Content 

* NATS CLI cheat sheets. 
    * Common commands and instructions for health checks. From basic to cluster management. 
    * Doubles as material for workshops and ad hoc training as there is currently no dedicated documentation for the NATS CLI.
* NATS cheat sheets. Mostly marketing - product overview. 

## The renderer used

Playground - limited re-usability. Will probably transform this to typst when the content is done.

Design goals:
* Render structured cheatsheets as PDF using PDFBox
* Auto layout
* Allow for content and style adjustment while retaining consistent look and feel

## TODO

Once content is done abandon code and move the content to typst. 
* https://typst.app/
* https://github.com/typst/typst
