# NATS CLI and NATS product cheat sheets

## Content 

* NATS_CLI_Cheatsheet.json.pdf - Basic usage, benchmarking - one pager
* NATS_CLI_Cheatsheet_ext.json.pdf - Extended - health checks, debugging, cluster management
   
## PDFs are rendered from Json

Playground project - limited re-usability. Will probably transform the content to typst eventually

Design goals:
* Render structured cheatsheets as PDF using PDFBox
* Auto layout
* Allow for content and style adjustment while retaining consistent look and feel

## TODO

Once content is stable, abandon rendered and move to typst. 
* https://typst.app/
* https://github.com/typst/typst
